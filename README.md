Driving Excellence in Customer Relations Through Data-Driven Coaching 
Introduction
#Project overview: 
This project aims to develop a predictive model that helps managers quickly identify performance trends among advisors based on key performance indicators (KPIs). The model will classify advisor performance levels and provide personalized coaching recommendations based on their strengths and improvements aeras.
#Problem & Motivation:
As a Customer Relations Advisor, I am evaluated on various KPIs like Average Handling Time, Schedule Adherence, After Chat Work, and more. I noticed that while we track these metrics, there is no predictive system to proactively support advisors before performance issues occur. This inspired me to create a predictive coaching model using data analysis. 
#Why this matters:
Currently managers must manually analyze multiple KPIs and evaluation scores to determine coaching needs.
This process is: 
	Time-consuming
	Reactive (issues are only addressed after poor performance), 
	Inconsistent (different managers may interpret KPIs differently).
	Objectives of the project
With our predictive model, managers can:
	Pro-actively identify struggling advisors before performance issues escalate
	Focus coaching efforts on the aeras that truly impact performance 
	Ensure data-driven decision-making rather than relying on intuition
For advisors, this model will :
	Help them understand which KPIs drive their performance scores,
	Provide personalized feedback for continuous improvement
